# This should be fun!

I chose to start this as I've realized that I need to start using GitHub for my repo rather than my folder structure, and I need to start remembering that if I don't learn how to tuse the tools of my trade, I will rapidly fall behind....so this beauty has been created.

## Expectations
So let's make sure we're on the same page from the start, I'm new to this and it will forever be a work in progress as my thinking changes.
My initial upload is all my code, working or not.
I'm hoping that this repo is found by you wondereful people out there to add to it, tell me how to fix it, or join me in fixing it.

As I work through my fears of code you might as well get to know me here [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travisesimon/)
